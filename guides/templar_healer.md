  ### Resto Staff

   Radiating Regeneration - keeping this HoT up all the time is quite useful. It's duration is 10 seconds and it's easy to keep it up 100% of the time.

   [![Combat Prayer](images/ability_restorationstaff_003_b.png)](https://eso-hub.com/en/skills/weapon/restoration-staff/combat-prayer)
   Combat Prayer - A tiny heal that I don't use as a heal; I use this primarly for it's buffing ability. The buff provides Minor Beserk [Damage Increase], Minor Resolve [Physical Resistance]. This is best used right before combat and during combat as your healing requirements allow.

   [![Illustrious Healing](images/ability_restorationstaff_004b.png)](https://eso-hub.com/en/skills/weapon/restoration-staff/illustrious-healing)
   Illustrious Healing - An AoE heal that's great for topping off the group, where positioning is important.

  ### Guild / Alliance War

  [![Siege Weapon Shield](images/ability_ava_004_b.png)](https://eso-hub.com/en/skills/alliance-war/support/siege-weapon-shield)
  Siege Weapon Shield - Puts an AoE that protects both players and siege weapons from siege damage. Great for protections on the Ram, covering other's balistas, or when enemies decided to drop meatbags on the group.

  [![Barrier](images/ability_ava_006_a.png)](https://eso-hub.com/en/skills/alliance-war/support/replenishing-barrier)
  Replenishing Barrier - A 4.5k AoE shield that hits allies around you. This is especially good for pushes into keeps, giving you a little bit of breathing room during heavy-damage interactions, or to give yourself a moment as you're teetering on the brink of death.

  [![Energy Orb](images/ability_undaunted_004b.png)](https://eso-hub.com/en/skills/guild/undaunted/energy-orb)
  Energy Orb - Floating healing balls that are amazing if your allies activate the synergy. Without an ally activing the synergy it's still a decent heal-over-time, but it's true power is in the synergy.

  ### Templar - Restoring Light

  [![Breath of Life](images/ability_templar_breath_of_life.png)](https://eso-hub.com/en/skills/templar/restoring-light/breath-of-life)
  Breath of Life - a great powerful burst heal, but it's especially useful when an ally is taking damage but you can't locate them in your vacinity.

  [![Extended Ritual](images/ability_templar_extended_ritual.png)](https://eso-hub.com/en/skills/templar/restoring-light/extended-ritual)
  Extended Ritual - a large AoE that both cleanses harmful effects and heals over time. The synergy for allies is also quite useful here. I use this religiously when the group is stationary or we're working from a central point.

  [![Channeled Focus](images/ability_templar_channeled_focus.png)](https://eso-hub.com/en/skills/templar/restoring-light/channeled-focus)
  Channeled Focus - a small AoE whose morph restores magicka while providing Major Resolve. I use this on the ram and on flags.

  ### Templar - Aedric Spear

  [![Aurora Javelin](images/ability_templar_ripping_spear.png)](https://eso-hub.com/en/skills/templar/aedric-spear/aurora-javelin)
  Aurora Javelin - a great quick CC skill for getting people away from you; also fun to knock them off of high places with the knockback. This can be spammed and, as a kicker, it ignores the enemy's resistances. As the damage increases based on distance, hitting someone running can also be useful.

  [![Luminous Shards](images/ability_templar_light_strike.png)](https://eso-hub.com/en/skills/templar/aedric-spear/luminous-shards)
  Luminous Shards - I use this damage AoE to apply light damage to an area, but mainly for the synergy that allies can activate. It restores both magicka and stamina, so it's useful for all classes.

Strategy
------

 * **Situational Awareness**
   If you're going to master one strategy, attempt to master situational awareness. As a healer it's your job to keep everyone alive, how can you do that if you're always playing catch-up? Simple answer, you can't. 
   
   * **Situational Awareness : Where is everyone?**
	   For my gameplay, I try and keep basic track of the entire group's position and I try and predict where they'll stay. For the most part this isn't overly challenging as most people have a specific personality. Keeping track of your group mates can be considerably harder if you have numerous wildcards; luckily in my group the number of wildcards are quite limited, so I'm usually able to track down a player immediately as I see their health dipping.
   
   * **Situational Awarness : Where are they going?**
	   In addition to tracking your player's position you're also going to want to know where the group is heading. What's the use of dropping an AoE if the group is going to be moving 1 second later? If you know the group is going to be engaging an enemy, or moving toward a specific location then it's best to lead your AoE to get as much coverage as you can. 
 * **Keep Moving**
   A stationary healer is a dead healer. - Someone
   
   * **Flanking your friends**
		I find that during a fight I'm, more often than not, constantly circling around the exterior of the group. I do this because I want to keep the group in my sights at all times, and when dealing with directional heals, such as Breath of Life, Healing Orbs, or Combat Praryer, you want to have as many group mates in front of you as possible. By circling the group, I'm mobile and I'm usually directing heals toward the heart of the group.
		
   * **Float like a butterfly & sting like a mosquitto**
		I use 2 "attacks" in my rotation, one is to help synergize the group and the other is to get players away from me. My goal isn't the death of others, it's to keep my group mates alive so they can do the killing blow. If I'm attacking a player it's either to weave, build ultimate, restore resources (that's a section by itself), or to get them away from me. If you're doing the job of a DPS'er, then who is doing yours?
